Weâ€™ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way.
The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes,
 challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT,
  which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response.
